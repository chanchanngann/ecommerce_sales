### Summary
* Part 1.Carried out univariate & bivaruate analysis to explore the dataset of the e-commerce site Wish, also to answer some inspiring questions:

   1. How is human sensitiveness to price drops? (impact of discount on number of units sold)

   2. What are the top categories of products which sell best?

   3. Do bad products sell? How is the relationship between the quality of a product and its success? Does the price factor into this?
   
   4. Do seller's fame factor into top products? 
   
   5. Does ad-boosting help to sell more?
   
   6. Do the number of tags (making a product more discoverable) factor into the success of a product ?
   
* Part 2. Developed 4 regression models to predict number of units sold (how well a product is going to sell)
